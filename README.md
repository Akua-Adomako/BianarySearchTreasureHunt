Binary Search Treasure Hunt
Welcome to the Binary Search Treasure Hunt! This is an interactive web game that uses the concept of binary search to find a hidden treasure. Players will guess the index where the treasure is located by following the logic of binary search, and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.

Features
Interactive Boxes: The game visualizes an array of boxes, each representing an index. The treasure is hidden in one of these boxes.
Binary Search Logic: Players input their guess (index) and are given feedback based on the binary search approach: whether their guess is too high or too low.
Dynamic UI: Smooth transitions and hover effects add a fun, engaging element to the game.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Game Score: The number of attempts made is tracked and displayed to encourage the player to guess efficiently.

How It Works
The game generates a fixed number of boxes (9 in this case), each labeled with an index.
The treasure is randomly hidden in one of these boxes.
The player makes guesses by entering an index number.
The game provides hints:
If the guess is too low, the player is informed to search to the right.
If the guess is too high, the player is told to search to the left.
When the correct index is guessed, the treasure box is revealed, and the game ends.
